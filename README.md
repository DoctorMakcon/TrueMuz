Main goal of this project provide musicians additional support from fans.
Musicians could post here raw demos of their tracks or even another variation of track with different musical instruments, vocals etc.
Also could provide background history about track creation process.

Project participated in the Innovation Sandbox in the Coherent Solutions BY. Took second place.
Created by team of 5 members: 4 devs & 1 UI/UX.
Development stopped since found lot of issues with music copyrights, labels etc.
